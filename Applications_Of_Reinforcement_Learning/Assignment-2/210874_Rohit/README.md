First take the raw data in the input and filter the usable numeric data which we use to create the model by some python libraries.further,split the data in test_data and train_data and apply the linear regression from sklearn library.
After that ,we fit the model on training data by model.fit function
Now, our model is devoloped  and we can now test the test_data and analyse the predicted value by using graph by matplotlib libraries
after model being created, we serialise the model so that we can use this further by just calling it (deserialization).

Sabuj Kumar Kundu, (sabuj[AT]iitk.ac.in) , Phone: 0512-259-7643 (O) , PhD (IISc Bangalore)," Research Interests: My research investigates the application of isotope geochemistry in a wide variety of geological, environmental and hydrocarbon samples to better understand large-scale Earth System Science processes. I use single and multi-collector ICP-MS, electron microprobe (EPMA), optical microscopes, scanning electron microscope (SEM), and as all Earth Scientist do - field work for most of my research activities. My current research projects proves the impact of climate change on high-altitude cryosphere, constrain the response of Surface Earth System to past climate perturbations, application of inorganic tracers in hydrocarbon exploration, as well as source apportionment of airborne particulate matters. My research interest therefore frequently overlaps various Earth Systems such as the solid Earth, hydrosphere, and atmosphere, but I address all of them using the radiogenic and stable isotopes."

In addition, I intend to set a bridge between deformation and metamorphic processes, and explain deep-crustal phenomena, like partial melting and melt migration. The application of my research work covers a range of subjects- structural geology, tectonics, petrology and geodynamics, with a special emphasis on important factors controlling strain localization and deformation mechanisms during tectonic movement of lithospheric plates. The key tools I employ to understand these processes include mostly experimental rock deformations under elevated pressure-temperature conditions and field investigations, coupled with analytical and numerical modelling."

Neurons interact with each other forming circuits, which process sensory information and drive appropriate behaviors. We are interested in understanding the fundamental mechanisms used by neural circuits for processing information. Our initial focus is on circuits in deeper layers of the olfactory system (sense of smell). We use a variety of insects as model systems, including grasshoppers, flies and mosquitoes, and a variety of techniques, including in vivo electrophysiology, histology, behavioral observations, genetic manipulations, and computational modeling."

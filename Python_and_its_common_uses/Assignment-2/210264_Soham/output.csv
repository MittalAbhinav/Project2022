Spectroscopic studies on intermolecular clusters provide means to explore various intermolecular interactions and molecular dynamics. Our group is interested in studying intermolecular clusters and understanding bulk phenomena, such as chemical reactions, crystallization, and solvation from a molecular point of view. For this purpose, we plan to use a helium nanodroplet isolation machine coupled with a high-resolution infrared laser. The helium nanodroplets are clusters of several thousand helium atoms that have an equilibrium temperature of 0.4 kelvin and are superfluid in nature. Superfluid helium nanodroplets have proven to be an ideal medium to isolate individual molecules, and form intermolecular clusters. Moreover, helium nanodroplets are ideal nanoreactors to study chemical reactions at a microscopic level. Studying chemical reactions in helium nanodroplets will help us gain insights into chemical processes that take place in the interstellar space, where there is hardly any thermal energy available as temperatures are of the order of only a few Kelvin! We will also use electronic structure calculations to complement our experimental findings."
